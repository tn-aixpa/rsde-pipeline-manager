Remote Sensing Pipeline manager provides a GUI and an API for managing the remote sensing data pipelines. It is possible to start and monitor the pipeline execution, download the resulting products.

Each pipeline execution, or **elaboration**, represents an instance of a pipeline and is defined with

- reference to the pipeline instance in the platform
- name of the elaboration
- list of parameters (e.g., defined using Web UI)
- status (one of ``RUNNING``, ``COMPLETE``, ``ERROR``)

## Quick Start

To run locally the application in development mode, Java 17+, Apache Maven, and Node.JS are required.

### Back-end
Build the Spring Boot application:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

Run the application
```bash
java -jar target/rsde-pipeline-manager-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The application API is available at ``http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html``. 

### Front-end

Go to the ``frontend`` directory and install the necessary dependencies
```
npm install
```

Then, run the front-end (make sure to `cd` to `frontend` first):
```
npm start
```
The front-end is available at ``http://localhost:4200/``. 

## Configuration

### Back-end

Back-end configuration properties are defined in the ``src/main/resources/application.yml`` and may also be passed as the corresponding environment variables.

Specifically, it is possible to define the DB configuration using standard JDBC properties

```yaml
jdbc:
  dialect: ${JDBC_DIALECT:org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect}
  driver: ${JDBC_DRIVER:org.h2.Driver}
  url: ${JDBC_URL:jdbc:h2:file:./data/db}
  user: ${JDBC_USER:rsde}
  password: ${JDBC_PASS:rsde}
  show-sql: false
  max-pool-size: ${JDBC_MAX_POOL_SIZE:10}
  min-pool-size: ${JDBC_MIN_POOL_SIZE:10}
  idle-timeout: ${JDBC_IDLE_TIMEOUT:600000}
  keep-alive-timeout: ${JDBC_KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT:0}
  connection-timeout: ${JDBC_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT:30000}
  data-source-properties: {}
``` 
To connect the execution to the digitalhub platform, the following properties should be provided:

- ``core.token (DHCORE_ACCESS_TOKEN)``: Core access token (e.g., Personal Access Token) of long duration. 
- ``core.apiEndpoint (DHCORE_ENDPOINT)``: Core endpoint address.
- ``core.configUrl (CONFIG_URL)``: URL of the configuration file (e.g. , http://, file://, or classpath: schemas).

### Pipeline configuration
The pipeline configurations should be provided as a YAML file in the following manner
```yaml
elaborations:
  - name: flood
    projectId: protezione-civile
    taskId: kfp+pipeline://protezione-civile/d1a561c8929e4a0ba851c937d80c86ed
    workflowId: kfp://protezione-civile/protezione_civile:9d571837bfab4797ac5c6d2bc5e5d411
    tag: water
    fixedParameters:
      shapeArtifactName: bosco
      dataArtifactName: data_s2_deforestation
```
Here

- ``name`` is the unique name for the pipeline type. To each type a corresponding UI should be provided.
- ``projectId`` defines the platform project where the elaboration is performed
- `taskId`` and ``workflowId`` identify the instances of the workflow and the corresponding pipeline task to execute.
- ``tag`` used to group the workflows for security groups
- ``fixedParameters`` define the values of the parameters that are passed statically as the pipeline parameters.

An execution of the pipeline is configured with a set of specific parameters with the corresponding form. See the implementation of ``flood`` and ``forest`` UIs for reference.

### Front-end
The configuration of the front-end environments is made through the standard Angular environments. Only ``SERVER_URL`` defining the reference to the backend API should be configured.

## Development

The repo contains both the back-end code and the front-end.

The backend-application is implemented as a Java Spring Boot application (see ``src`` folder for the code). Dependencies are defined in ``pom.xml``.

The front-end application (``frontend`` folder) is implemented using Angular framework. Dependencies are defined in ``frontend/package.json``.

### Build container images

To build a docker image 

```bash
docker build -t rsde-pipeline-manager:VERSION .
```

To run a docker container

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -t rsde-pipeline-manager:VERSION
```

Pass the configuration properties as environment variables.

### Run within the platform

Define the container function
```python
import digitalhub as dh

proj = dh.get_or_create_project("protezione-civile")

function_rs = proj.new_function(
    "rsde-pipeline-manager",
    kind="container",
    image="rsde-pipeline-manager:VERSION")
```

Create project secret with the long token (e.g., personal access token) named ``DHCORE_ACCESS_TOKEN``.

Run the function as the ``serve`` action
```python
function_rs.run(
	action="serve",
	secrets=["DHCORE_ACCESS_TOKEN"],
        envs=[{"name": "DHCORE_ENDPOINT", "value": "https://core.example.com"}, {"name": "CONFIG_URL", "value": "[https://core.example.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tn-aixpa/rsde-pipeline-manager/refs/heads/main/config.yml)"}],
	service_type="ClusterIP",
	service_ports=[{"port": 8080, "target_port": 8080}]
)
```
